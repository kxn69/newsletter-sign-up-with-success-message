## My process

I started out with designing the layout and making it responsive, then i added the script which handles the user interactions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SaaS
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt more on css positions while working on this project, I also used saas for the first time and it was amazing. Might do more with it in more projects


### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on developing more of my css skill as time goes on.
